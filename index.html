								A Netflix movie by Martin Scorsese of the true story of Frank Sheeran's life. In the 1950s, truck driver Frank Sheeran gets involved with Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania crime family. As Sheeran climbs the ranks to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa -- a powerful Teamster tied to organized crime.

								This year's Thanksgiving was not as great as I expected it to be. To start off, some of our family members would bring a lot of their friends that we didn't know. There would be way too many people for our small house, and it would be loud. Then, my cousins kept annoying me since they are younger, and wouldn't stop bugging me. Now we know to not host another Thanksgiving again.

									Work is always a blast! I have so much fun working at Chick Fil A. It's always great torturing my co-workers with really lame jokes, and laughing with them. Working at Chick Fil A was probably the real highlight of my break, since it was the only time I had serious fun.
